# Running the application
### Running the server
To run the server, cd to server folder and run
```js
npm install
npm start
```
### Running the client
This is easiest to run using linux, but it can be run in windows.
first you must install nodejs from the node js website
then you will use either open your linux terminal or windows powershell
cd into client and run the following commands

```js
npm install
npm install -g bower ember-cli
bower install
ember serve
```

Then you will navigate to the specified url
the client and server aspects of this example run seperately, but they are
linked together
